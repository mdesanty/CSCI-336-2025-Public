    <h1>Dogs</h1>
    <p>
      Dogs are domesticated mammals, not natural wild animals. They were originally bred from wolves. They have been bred by
      humans for a long time, and were the first animals ever to be domesticated.
      <br />
      Today, some dogs are used as pets, others are used to help humans do their work. They are a popular pet because they are
      usually playful, friendly, loyal, and listen to humans.
